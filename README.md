# MLB-Pitch-Velocity-Gap-Prediction-Model
This project aims to predict the velocity differential (velocity gap) between a pitcher's primary fastball and their breaking pitches — including cutters, sliders, sweepers, slurves, and curveballs — using pitch-level Statcast data from the 2020–2024 MLB regular seasons.
